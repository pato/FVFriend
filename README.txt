After many hours of work, the newest version for FV Friend is finally done! Like I promised, it is completely free to those that already purchased any version of the FV Friend before. This latest version finally fixes the problem in where the bot started skipping plots!


The latest update includes:
-Fixed bot from skipping plots!
-Fine Tuning option to fix the bot in case of resolution change
-Distance calculator included (to calculate pixels between two points) which can be used to Fine Tune
-Fixed options menu
-Modified the options GUI
-Added a check for updates buttons

I am currently working on the next version of the FV Friend - Farm Ville Bot. This new version will include these updates:

-Fixed the options menu
-The options now load when FV Friend starts up
-Added the option to Fine Tune the movement (in case Zynga makes another change to the resolution)

This update will of course be free! But will only update an excising install, on an already registered computer.

At the moment the most up to date stable release is 2.0. This new version comes with many new interesting updates such as:
-New options menu (beta)
-Fixed to work with Farmville's new resolution
-New transparent hidden mode
-Support for seeders and tractor!!! (F2)
-Hotkeys remapped
-Disable hotkeys when hidden
-Disable snap-to edges
-Toggle always-on-top

Some of the feautres are:
-Harvests 20x20 farms in 12.1 seconds
-Seeds 20x20 farm in 12.1 seconds
-Plows 20x20 farm in 12.1 seconds
-Places haybals at unbelievable speeds (Spend $100,000 = Get 5,000xp)
-Saves last used settings for columns and mouse speed
-Now comes with a speed so fast you won't believe your eyes
-Completly unique and special GUI with side hiding capabilities

At the moment the bot is not perfect, and I know that, that is why I am constantly working on how to make it better. And with your support we can make this be as best as possible!
